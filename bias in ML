1. Interaction bias
    1. People were asked to draw a shoe for the computer. Most people drew a shoe which is very similar to everyone else. As more people participated in the game, the computer failed to recognize other types of shoes!
2. Latent bias
    1. If you were training a computer on what a physicist looks like and you are using pictures of past physicists, your algorithm will end up with latent bias skewing towards men.
3. Selection bias
    1. Say you are training a model to recognize faces, where you grab images from the internet or from your own photo library, are you making sure to select photos representing everyone?
